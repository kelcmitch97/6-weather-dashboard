# Weather-Dashboard Challenge

Module 6: Server-Side APIs Weather Dashboard

# Challenge 

The purpose of this application is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

# Description

In my application, a user will begin by searching a city in the search form on the left of the page. Once the user clicks the search button, two things will happen:

1. The current weather section will populate and includes: 
* City, Date, Icon-image
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind Speed
* UV index
2. The 5-days weather forecast also displays below the current weather conditions section and it includes the following information for each day:
* Date
* Icon image
* Temperature
* Humidity
 
The local storage is used to store the previous search city and display them to the user in the left side of the page under the list group. 
If the user wants to see the past search city weather condition again, just click the list group item cities under the clear history button.

## Mock-up:

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
